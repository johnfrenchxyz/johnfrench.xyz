Description:

When examining the Tesla Motors website, I found a discrepancy between the functionality and attention to detail between the sleek desktop site and the functional, but lackluster mobile site.  I set out to solve some of those problems with a UI redesign that would extend up to the desktop and provide a truly responsive and more usable experience.

Challenges:

1. Create a more enticing and engaging mobile site that matches the polish of the desktop site.
2. Improve mobile navigation usability without detracting from the brand identity.
3. Create a truly responsive template that wouldnâ€™t require completely separate layouts between devices.
