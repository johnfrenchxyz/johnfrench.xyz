excerpt:  While the text editor of choice is a fierce topic of discussion for developers, Atom is I've come to love and use. For this case study, I take a look at the site that promotes Atom and hopefully uncover some difficult-to-spot usability problems, while making the site better and more accesible though my contributions.

## Description:

While the text editor of choice is a fierce topic of discussion for developers, Atom is I've come to love and use. For this case study, I take a look at the site that promotes Atom and hopefully uncover some difficult-to-spot usability problems, while making the site better and more accesible though my contributions.

Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

<!-- {% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %} -->
