        <p class="portfolio-item-excerpt">David and Luke (of Bloodroot Blades) are blacksmiths and custom knife makers. They are true artisans and make incredibly beautiful knives and tools, often out of reclaimed materials. I worked with them initially doing some UX consultation for their website, but since then, decided to give a little more personality to one of their projects.  They wrote a lexicon of knife-making terms for beginners.  I worked with them to turn that lexicon into a more beautiful and interactive experience.</p>

I was tasked with quickly developing a promotional site that would subsequently be used for registration and general communication about the conference.  I decided to conduct an experiment with the design in which I  attempt to create an accessible interface that mimicked some current design trends where accessibility is often ignored.</p>

        <p class="portfolio-item-excerpt">While the text editor of choice is a fierce topic of discussion for developers, Atom is one I've come to love and use (even as I type this case study right now).  You can [find out more about Atom here](http://www.atom.io).  For this case study, I take a look at Atom's official site and hopefully uncover some difficult-to-spot usability problems, while making the site better and more accesible through my contributions.  What's better than helping improve platforms you love?</p>

        <p class="portfolio-item-excerpt">The web presence of the College of Agricultural & Environmental Sciences at the University of Georgia is a complex network of sites, pages, and databases that was in dire need of a massive overhaul.  Through in-depth research audits, UI/UX redesign, thoughtful web development choices in line with modern standards, and extensive testing, we were able to completely repackage and re-deliver both the public facing site as well as the internal CMS.</p>

        <p class="portfolio-item-excerpt">Sharing code is important. Whether it is a blog post or documentation, having clear code examples is fundamentally important to communication in the developer ecosystem.  That is why I feel it is paramount that these code samples meet modern accessibility standards.  For code samples, contrast is particularly important.  That is why I developed a CSS code theme that meets contrast standards.</p>

        <p class="portfolio-item-excerpt">While I was examining the Tesla Motors website, I found a discrepancy between the functionality and attention to detail between the sleek desktop site and the functional, but lackluster mobile site.  I set out to solve some of those problems with a UI redesign that would extend up to the desktop and provide a truly responsive and more usable experience.</p>

        <p class="portfolio-item-excerpt">Walk Georgia was a program developed in 2007 to help educate the general population about healthy living and exercise.  After seven years of existence, the program received a grant from the Coca Cola Foundation to expand it’s reach.  I was hired as the lead Web Designer for the project and was tasked with completely reimagining it from the ground up.  The result was a 1,000% (yes, one thousand) increase in our total number of active users.</p>

With over a hundred different offices all over the state, Extension is a massive organization with a large online presence.  The needs of each office were sometimes vastly different, and my team and I had to develop a template and web platform that would work well for all users and all faculty and staff to increase overall productivity and help keep the budget stable.</p>
