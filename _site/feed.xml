        <title>Welcome to Jekyll!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- 
&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

        <title>NETC 2017 Design &amp; Development</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/johnfrench.xyz/images/portfolio/netc/netc2017.png&quot; alt=&quot;A computer, smartphone, and notes sit on a table&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Extension Technology Conference is a yearly gathering of IT professionals from across the United States.  I was tasked with quickly developing a promotional site that would subsequently be used for registration and general communication about the conference.  I decided to conduct an experiment with the design in which I  attempt to create an accessible interface that mimicked some current design trends where accessibility is often ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/johnfrench.xyz/images/portfolio/netc/netc-screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of the NETC2017 website layout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://johnfrenchxyz.github.io/NETC/&quot; class=&quot;portfolio-button&quot;&gt;View the NETC 2017 Site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Unfortunately, because this project for the University of Georgia, the GitHub repo must remain private, but you can view the source code by visiting the site itself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting aspects of creating this particular template was playing with acceptable color contrast ratios.  Because I was tasked with the design of the site (as well as the development), I decided to test a running theory I had.  So often I see websites winning awards or receiving widespread recognition for their design, when the foundation of that design is built upon color schemes that do not meet modern guidelines for proper accessibility.  While the sites are often undeniably beautiful, they take a “shortcut” to get there based on a path of least resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many modern design trends feature color schemes where a light pastel is paired with text of a very similar shade.  To a person with no visual impairments, this creates a beautiful effect.  But that same text can be completely unreadable for a large percentage of users.  The same can be said of font-size, or decisions to place text above areas in an image where it can become washed out or difficult to read.  When I discuss this with designers and express the importance of inclusive design, I am often met with understandable frustration.  What I mean is that, for most designers, their job is to create beautiful things.  While the web is often the pathway by which we have access to beautiful things, it’s primary purpose (most oftenly) is a platform, or tool for a user to get information or to complete a task.  User Experience is a discipline on top of that goal that can then seek to make our interfaces as beautiful and functional as possible.  For the developer, this may mean making a page load as quickly and efficiently as possible. Or coming up with an algorithm that can infer certain details to save the user time.  So, while I understand the frustration of designers and developers who simply want to make beautiful things as they see them, there are many who may be unable to use or experience those things in the same way.  I believe that type of empathy in design takes time to learn, and it is never completely accomplished.  That is one of the reasons that diversity in design and development teams is so important, to offer a more complete picture of all possible users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, I have a sinking suspicion that beautiful interfaces and rich color schemes and accessibility don’t have to be mutually exclusive.  Often, the sites that tout accessibility or inclusive design would not win an award for groundbreaking aesthetic experimentation - perhaps rightly so - because that is neither their purpose nor their endeavor.  But as someone who has a passion both for beautiful, aesthetically pleasing websites and accessibility, I wanted to see if I could come up with a color scheme that mimicked some of these design trends I am seeing, while still maintaining proper contrast ratios and font-sizes.  This website for the NETC 2017 served as my guinea pig of sorts.  While I do not think it is perfect, I do think that it is an indication that if usability, inclusive design, and accessibility are built into the fabric of your product from day one, then the best practices don’t become a hinderance, but rather an advantage (as best practices are designed to do).  If we can make sites that look beautiful and work efficiently for the largest possible percentage of the population, I believe that is something to strive for.  And we need to be able to fail gracefully and publically in order to learn and correct our own misconceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site is built using HTML/CSS/JS and the Jekyll templating engine.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Usability Improvements for Atom.io</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/johnfrench.xyz/images/portfolio/atom/atom.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Atom Logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the text editor of choice is a fierce topic of discussion for developers, Atom is one I’ve come to love and use (even as I type this case study right now).  You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atom.io&quot;&gt;find out more about Atom here&lt;/a&gt;.  For this case study, I take a look at Atom’s official site and hopefully uncover some difficult-to-spot usability problems, while making the site better and more accesible through my contributions.  What’s better than helping improve platforms you love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;disclaimer&quot;&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This case study is representative of the atom.io site as it exists in the Fall of 2016.  I plan on taking some of the findings of the case study and submitting them to the Atom team for consideration for future implementations.  But the shape their site may take in the future could be totally different than what they have now.  Lastly, no case study is intended to be a “gotcha” form of negativity.  I use Atom all the time, and their team has made a beautiful website that works very well.  But, as with anything else, all sites need improvements constantly, including mine.  I want to foster a community that can make suggestions for improvements to each other without negativity.  All right, my speech is over, now for the case study:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;challanges&quot;&gt;Challanges:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take the current Atom.io page and attempt to understand the goals and aesthetic desisions made by design team (who are awesome, by the way).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With the current design in mind, make small usability and accessibility improvements without compromising the vision of the site.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Attempt to promote cross-site consistency with simple solutions, and bring more functionality to more users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;state-of-the-homepage&quot;&gt;State of the Homepage:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of what makes this UX audit intersting is that the issues are subtle.  Some would probably argue that they are even negligable.  But, to me, &lt;strong&gt;good usability lives in studying the negligable&lt;/strong&gt;.  You know, those little features or interactions that subtly drive you crazy each time they happen, but are not big enough to make you delete the app or find a different favorite site.  The overall design and aesthetic of this site is beautiful (like most of the things GitHub does). Also, in terms of speed and mobile friendliness, the atom.io homepage acheives great scores.  So, what’s the problem?  I think making a few small (and a few big) changes could result in a drastic improvement to the site that I have already come to love so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;global-consistency&quot;&gt;Global Consistency:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my analysis of atom.io, I feel that the single biggest improvement would come from global consistency across the various pages of their site.  Currently, the homepage exists as a mobile friendly site that is great to use, and consistent in look and feel to the desktop version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take a look at the current mobile homepage:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/johnfrench.xyz/images/portfolio/atom/atom-mobile.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of missing labels on Atom.io&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And Compare that to the desktop homepage:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/johnfrench.xyz/images/portfolio/atom/current-homepage.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of missing labels on Atom.io&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the homepage is elegantly responsive and well designed.  The feel is consistent enough between mobile and desktop views to provide a great user experience.  But, when I pulled up atom.io on my mobile phone to search for a package, I was suprised to find that when I left the homepage and went deeper, the experience did not feel quite as consistent or responsive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The atom.io packages page on mobile:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/johnfrench.xyz/images/portfolio/atom/atom-mobile-packages-mockup.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of non-responsive package page design from atom.io.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this screenshot is not exactly a 1/1 ratio, you can hopefully notice how difficult it is to see and interact with certain elements on the screen.  The page ceases to be truly responsive.  I am not sure why there is this departure from the mobile-friendliness of the homepage.  Maybe it was because the search and result system was built elsewhere or with a different codebase and it was problematic to simply move it into the mobile theme - or maybe there is another justification that I am unaware of.  Even if the reason is 100% justifiable, it is also 100% true that the inconsistency between the packages page and the homepage is not ideal for usability.  And practically, when analyzed for mobile friendliness, these pages got only a 75/100 and a 58/100 for mobile speed, while the homepage got 100/100 for mobile-friendliness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving the packages page would be as “simple” as collapsing the collumns of search results into a single column on small screens.  This would improve readability greatly.  It is the small steps and considerations like this that help make sites usabile for everyone.  Even though packages can’t be installed using the mobile phone, I still enjoy browsing available packages on my phone and would benefit from a more responsive experience.  Here are some tips to consider when attempting to make a page more mobile-friendly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Always remember to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_viewport.asp&quot;&gt;configure the viewport&lt;/a&gt;.  This can make a big difference for your mobile users, as the viewport will be properly scaled to their device.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use legible font sizes. &lt;a href=&quot;http://webaim.org/techniques/fonts/#font_size&quot;&gt;Read up on font-size best practices here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enable gzip compression for all HTTP requests on your server.  This can be particularly helpful to users on mobile devices, because the faster you are able to load elements of your site, the better the experience will be.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/EnableCompression&quot;&gt;Read about how to enable compression on your server here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;homepage-accessibility-problems&quot;&gt;Homepage Accessibility Problems:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read a quote once, and I am embarrased to say I did not write down it’s author, but the summary of the thought was, “There is no accessibility promised land in software.”  While it is our responsibility as developers to help &lt;strong&gt;all users&lt;/strong&gt; access our software, the best-practices of accessibility will always be changing because technology is always changing.  So, the best thing we can do is familiarize ourselves with the current standards to the best of our ability, and then take small steps to push our code and our interfaces to meet those standards.  As they change and adapt, so should we, because everyone deserves fair and equal access to content.  Atom.io, has definitely taken steps to be an accessible site, and I don’t want to give the impression that they haven’t - but I have identified some room for improvement, and I hope to use those as an educational exercise in this case study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;controls-and-media-elements-should-have-labels&quot;&gt;Controls and media elements should have labels:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a way, HTML labels represent an abstract tension between “good design” and “accessible web sites.”  A lot of designers I talk to sometimes feel limited in what they are able to do creatively because of usability restrictions.  While I understand that feeling in some ways, I think that &lt;strong&gt;if design is meant to impact people, then good web design should be usable for everyone, in order to impact the largest possible audience.  Good design and accessibility are not mutually exclusive.&lt;/strong&gt;  Not having a label on a media or form element is bad for users who rely on screen readers, because it might make it difficult to understand what the element does, or how it functions in the larger context of the site.  But sometimes, a label might get in the way of the design you want to create.  Take this example from Atom.io:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/johnfrench.xyz/images/portfolio/atom/atom-missing-labels.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of missing labels on Atom.io&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The element that is missing the label is the play button in the circle on the right of the image above.  When you examine this page with a screen reader (in my case, I did a test with ChromeVox) all you hear it say is, “button,” which creates obvious confusion and a lack of context.  Now, I agree completely with the instinct of the designer to not have a visible text label because it would ruin the aesthetic effect that the circle creates in the layout.  A good fix for something like this would be to have a label, but only make it “visible” (or readable) for screen readers.  For more information on how to create a fix this, &lt;a href=&quot;http://webaim.org/techniques/css/invisiblecontent/&quot;&gt;check out this article on invisible text for screen readers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;text-elements-should-have-a-reasonable-contrast-ratio&quot;&gt;Text elements should have a reasonable contrast ratio:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a big one! &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs282/en/&quot;&gt;According to the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, “285 million people are estimated to be visually impaired worldwide: 39 million are blind and 246 million have low vision.” Furthermore, colorblindness and related disorders make up an even larger segment of the population. Achromatopsia, for example, is a visual impairment that effects about 1 in every 33,000 people. That might not seem like many, but for a user who has that disorder (or a similar one), proper contrast makes a tremendous difference.  One of the biggest ways I see this come up is in contrast between backgrounds and text elements.  If the contrast is not significant enough, it can become very difficult for some user to distinguish.  Here is an example from the homepage of atom.io as it currently exists:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/johnfrench.xyz/images/portfolio/atom/current-homepage.png&quot; alt=&quot;The current color contrast of atom.io's homepage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see (especially as the image is a bit smaller than the actual dimension of the site), that already some of the text can be difficult to distinguish from the background.  Now, take this example when the same page is run through a Chrome extension that simulates visual impairments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/johnfrench.xyz/images/portfolio/atom/homepage-modified.png&quot; alt=&quot;The current atom.io page run though a filter that simulates color-impaired vision&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without the help of color to distinguish elements, the contrast alone is not sufficient to be truly visible.  This is another example of how “good design” and “web accessibility” can be at odds.  So often, I see designs that don’t have proper contrast ratios, and understand that the “best design” in terms of aesthetics may not match up with the “best design” in terms of proper contrast.  But can we truly say a design is successful, if a user is not able to read all text elements effecticely. So, what is the correct contrast ratio? Fear not!  &lt;a href=&quot;http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/&quot;&gt;You can just go to this site to check your site’s contrast&lt;/a&gt; to see if it meets the reccomended guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I beleive that it is best-practice to start mocking up your designs with proper contrast ratios in mind, as it will save you from having to fix these problems later.  I’ve seen some suggestions of developers providing an alternate version of their page, with a more accessible color palate or a text-only version of the content.  While I can’t argue that this solution may be effective in many cases, I would ask that developers include people with visual disabilities or impairments in their user testing for making these decisions.  Sometimes, if accessibility is not a priority, these alternate versions of sites can fall behind in maintenence, and the message the user would subconsciously receive in visiting a poorly maintained version of a site, is that their experience is less important than the average user.  It is absolutely imperative that we consider the emotional implications of our design for all users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-web-page-should-have-the-contents-human-language-indicated-in-the-markup&quot;&gt;The web page should have the content’s human language indicated in the markup:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Declaring the human language on your page is important for many reasons, but for accessibility, it can effect the way certain readers like braille readers interact with the content of the page.  This is probably the simplest problem on this list to fix, so build it into your workflow and it will likely come in handy in the future. It can be remedied by adding a single attribute to the HTML tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Set the language --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;lang=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;en&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “en” stands for “English,” but you should obviously use the language code that matches your page’s language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wrapping-up&quot;&gt;Wrapping Up:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there were a few more accessibility issues I discovered, I think these were the most noteworthy.  Sometimes with accessibility checking software, you’ll get errors that don’t actually have an impact on the end user, but that the software flags none-the-less.  And therein lies what I beleive to be the overarching theme of this case study:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-a-usable-site-is-an-ongoing-process-even-after-a-site-is-launched&quot;&gt;Building a usable site is an ongoing process, even after a site is launched:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we as designers and developers can do a lot to ensure that our sites will be useable for everyone, we will inevitably make mistakes, technology will change and present new challanges, and we will constantly be learning techniques.  So, if accessibility isn’t a part of your initial design process, start to think about ways in which it can be implemented.  If usability audits or testing don’t happen until after you’re site is launched, maybe consider doing them much, much sooner.  I find it is the small, ongoing changes that can really make a difference.  In the same way that you might be constantly tweaking code to make it faster, or constantly altering a design to get it pixel-perfect, I encourage everyone to tinker frequently with usability and accessibility in their site.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>UGA CAES Redesign</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/johnfrench.xyz/images/portfolio/caes/UGA-CAES-portfolio.png&quot; alt=&quot;Growing grapes advertising the UGA College of Ag and Environmental Sciences&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the lead web developer, my responsibility was to take the initial template created by the design team and make recommendations about adherence to modern web development standards.  Once the design was finalized, I was responsible for converting the PDF mockups into functional HTML/CSS/JS pages.  Lastly, I assisted in converting those pages into our Java-based CMS, Adobe Experience Manager and assisted with testing, bug fixes and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Status: The site is currently in internal use only and is scheduled for launch at the beginning of November. The final stages of mockups can be showed below.  Additionally, because of policies of the University of Georgia I am unable to directly share the GitHub repository, but the compiled mock ups can be viewed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://johnfrenchxyz.github.io/UGA/&quot; class=&quot;portfolio-button&quot;&gt;View the CAES Redesign Elements (Mockups)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Challenges:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sheer volume.  As with many large-scale websites, the UGA CAES network has thousands upon thousands of pages and individual users, some of whom rely on daily access to our site in order to do their jobs.  Our update, therefore, had to be pushed out without interrupting current services. It was also imperative that we provided thorough documentation and training to our internal staff.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After the audit, we had to develop a new template that met all the guidelines of a modern web platform.  Once the design was in place, I was responsible for taking the mockups and converting them into a function HTML/CSS/JS template for review.  It was my responsibility to make sure everything was usable and accessible, and could fit clearly into the responsive nature of the new site.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once the template was completed, we had to develop dozens of individual page components that would eventually be used by admins to add content to their sites and pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-starting-point&quot;&gt;The Starting Point:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand the effectiveness of the update, it is important to understand what we were updating. While it was advanced at the time, the template has become wildly outdated in every way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/johnfrench.xyz/images/portfolio/caes/current-caes-homepage.png&quot; alt=&quot;The old CAES hompage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The template was not responsive and it did not reflect a modern aesthetic that users expect when they visit a website.  Many of the techniques used in the development of the old site are also currently obsolete, such as image mapping for header links.  While the site was accessible, even by modern standards, the user experience of using an outdated site was poor, and it was a concern that the design would be unappealing to new or prospective students thinking about attending the university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-progress&quot;&gt;Our Progress:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new site achieves a much cleaner and aesthetically pleasing design.  It was also crafted to give users immediate access to information that would be relevant to them, such as news and events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/johnfrench.xyz/images/portfolio/caes/new-caes-homepage.png&quot; alt=&quot;The new CAES homepage&quot; class=&quot;center-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the faculty’s perspective the site is also significantly more conducive to a productive workflow.  Previously, nothing about the web presence was centralized or unified.  This meant that if an employee moved from one department to another, the fragmentation may cause there to be two records of the employee in two different departments.  Rather than assigning the tedious task of maintenance to the web managers in each department, we built our site’s architecture around our centralized databases.  For personnel, this means a change will immediately be reflected across all pages.&lt;/p&gt;

For personnel, this means a change will immediately be reflected across all pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we solved another architectural problem related to the storage of images and documents.  If several departments needed a PDF to make available to users, there would be separate instances of the PDF across all of their websites. If one department noticed a typo, corrected it, and then re-uploaded it to their site - the other instances of the PDF would still have the same error.  This was obviously unacceptable.  By carefully designing the infrastructure within our CMS, we were able to create an environment where files can be stored, shared, and pushed to all of our sites.  If a change is made to that document, it is instantly pushed to all sites without any additional work to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;modular-component-design&quot;&gt;Modular Component Design:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted to make creating new sites, pages, and content as easy as possible for content managers.  Due to the nature of the faculty/staff at the University of Georgia, most of the people who are in charge of maintaining a web page have had no formal web design training.  With  the use of Adobe Experience Manager, we thoughtfully designed an entire toolset for our content managers so that they can simply drag, drop, and customize components to create pages.  We have designed and implemented everything from layout and column control components to lists that display personnel or a simple YouTube component.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.johnfrenchxyz.github.io/UGA/&quot;&gt;A complete list of the components can be found here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Accessible Code Coloring for Jekyll</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/johnfrench.xyz/images/portfolio/code/code-coloring.png&quot; alt=&quot;Color swatches&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing code is important. Whether it is a blog post or documentation, having clear code examples is fundamentally important to communication in the developer ecosystem.  That is why I feel it is paramount that these code samples meet modern accessibility standards.  For code samples, contrast is particularly important.  That is why I developed a CSS code theme that meets contrast standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/johnfrenchxyz/accessiblecode&quot; class=&quot;portfolio-button&quot;&gt;View on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Color often gives meaning and clarity to the different elements of code.  If the colors are too similar, then it might be difficult to find meaning in the code you’re looking at.  Similarly, if the background to foreground contrast ratio is too low, it can become very difficult to read, especially for users that might have visual impairments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kicker here is that there is no easy or global solution to this problem because most web platforms have their own way of styling and displaying code.  But I built this one in order to educate and ask yourself if the code snippets on your site are meeting the proper contrast ratios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are some samples of my code coloring theme at work in Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;python&quot;&gt;Python:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Python Code Coloring&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;copy&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# board size (even)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;board&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'0'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# 8 directions&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dirx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;diry&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;' '&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

        <title>Tesla Motors Mobile UI Design</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/johnfrench.xyz/images/portfolio/tesla/tesla-modelx.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tesla Model X&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are few companies I respect more than Tesla.  The cars that they create are beautiful in both form and function, and their commitment to fostering sustainable energy is above admirable.  I began following them as an admirer, and now I don’t think I will be able to justify buying a new car unless it is a Model 3.  When I find a company that I respect this deeply, I almost immediately start analyzing their website for insights on design, architecture, and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was examining the Tesla Motors website, I found a discrepancy between the functionality and attention to detail between the sleek desktop site and the functional, but lackluster mobile site.  I set out to solve some of those problems with a UI redesign that would extend up to the desktop and provide a truly responsive and more usable experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Challenges:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a more enticing and engaging mobile site that matches the polish of the desktop site.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improve mobile navigation usability without detracting from the brand identity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a truly responsive template that wouldn’t require completely separate layouts between devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;teslas-current-mobile-homepage&quot;&gt;Tesla’s Current Mobile Homepage:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/johnfrench.xyz/images/portfolio/tesla/tesla-home-current.png&quot; alt=&quot;Current Tesla.com mobile homepage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a screen capture of Tesla’s current mobile site (as of July of 2016).  It is by no means displeasing, but when it is compared to the desktop site - the layout and user experience feel lackluster.  To get started, I’ll show you the large, scrolling mockup I have created.  It provides all navigational and functional options of Tesla’s current mobile site, as well as its desktop experience as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/johnfrench.xyz/images/portfolio/tesla/tesla-home-iphone.png&quot; alt=&quot;My mockup of Tesla.com mobile homepage&quot; class=&quot;center-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-interface&quot;&gt;The Interface:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the first screenshot, the current Tesla mobile site feels almost like a fallback in comparison to the desktop site.  If a user goes to the desktop site first, and then later visits teslamotors.com on their mobile device, they may be underwhelmed by the difference in experience.  I am a firm believer that, despite the small screen size, a mobile interface can be just as rich and compelling as a desktop interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My addition of diagonal blocks and lines also breaks from the traditional box model of many modern web layouts, which serves to further illustrate the way that Tesla is far more than simply another car company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/johnfrench.xyz/images/portfolio/tesla/tesla-nav-current.png&quot; alt=&quot;Current Tesla.com mobile navigation&quot; class=&quot;center-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-hamburger-menu&quot;&gt;The Hamburger Menu:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the current Tesla mobile site, they are using the “E” of the Tesla logo, or “3” as in “Model 3” for their hamburger menu icon, due to the similarity in shape.  From a branding perspective, I understand this practice, however, by their very nature, hamburger menus obfuscate content.  Now that hamburger menus have been adopted by Google in their material design design framework, they have a certain level of ubiquity that offsets usability problems with hiding nav items, but because some users aren’t incredibly familiar with hamburger menus to begin with, I thought it would be a more user-focused decision to use a typical hamburger icon.  Using a traditional icon also has the added bonus of being easier to animate for into an “x” for closing the menu.  Currently, on the Tesla mobile site, clicking on the hamburger icon activates an off-canvas menu, but the icon does not change or give the user any indication of how they may close the menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/johnfrench.xyz/images/portfolio/tesla/tesla-nav-iphone.png&quot; alt=&quot;My mockup of Tesla.com mobile navigation&quot; class=&quot;center-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mobile-navigation&quot;&gt;Mobile Navigation:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes I brought to the mobile navigation help visually break up the different sections of the Tesla website, which would help first-time users be able to navigate the site with more confidence.  Additionally, the highlighted “Shop” and “My Tesla” buttons at the bottom of the navigation stick out far more than on the current navigation and draw more attention to two of the more important links in the navigation list.  In particular, the red “My Tesla” button creates a distinct target for users that frequently come back to that portion of the website.  Lastly, the typography in this mockup is significantly larger than the text in Tesla’s current off-canvas menu, which would help users with visual impairments see the navigation items better, and users with physical impairments to select the intended navigation item with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;responsive-scalability&quot;&gt;Responsive Scalability:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While their are advantages and disadvantages to responsive design versus separate desktop, tablet, and mobile sites, I believe that the user interface design should be consistent across all platforms and devices, while still highlighting the benefits of each device (touch functionality, etc.).  Below are the tablet and desktop variations of the site.  You can see how the navigation and content change slightly to accommodate the screen size, yet still remain true to the look and feel of the mobile mockup.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Walk Georgia</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/johnfrench.xyz/images/portfolio/walk-georgia/walk-georgia.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;A man on a hike stands tall on top of a mountain&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walk Georgia was a program developed in 2007 to help educate the general population about healthy living and exercise.  After seven years of existence, the program received a grant from the Coca Cola Foundation to expand it’s reach.  I was hired as the lead Web Designer for the project and was tasked with completely reimagining it from the ground up.  The result was a 1,000% (yes, one thousand) increase in our total number of active users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my work on this program, I was promoted to be lead Web Developer for the University of Georgia’s College of Agricultural &amp;amp; Environmental Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-challenges&quot;&gt;The Challenges:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We needed to dig through almost a decade of history and user response to the Walk Georgia site to determine the features users liked the most, what was missing that they wanted, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rethink the mechanics of the entire program, propose an improved platform, and then start the design and development process.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The development process included coming up with a way to measure and compare exercises that are categorically different like 30 minutes of running versus 30 minutes of yoga.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-design&quot;&gt;The Design:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important factors in the update was making a website that people enjoyed using.  The tech market is full of fitness tracking website and apps, so it was very important that we make design a priority and find our niche.  I made the design sleek, modern, and responsive.  The grant allotted the budget for a web app alone, so I wanted to make sure that the web app would be as enjoyable to use as a native app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://johnfrenchxyz.github.io/walkgeorgia/&quot; class=&quot;portfolio-button&quot;&gt;View the Design Mockup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Because this program was sponsored in part by the University of Georgia, I am unable to share the GitHub repository, but you can view the site by following the link above.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-platform&quot;&gt;The Platform:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting challenges with fitness tracking was the issue of comparison.  The Walk Georgia program involved virtually “walking” across a map of Georgia.  We decided early on that we wanted users to be able to use earn points for their exercise, and then use the points to travel across the state of Georgia, meet personal goals they have set for themselves in the platform, or compete against friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge rested in the diversity of the exercises.  I must give proper credit to the brilliance of my college, Aaron McCoy, for his leadership in the development of this algorithm to compare vastly different exercises.  How do you compare bowling to yardwork? How do you compare pull ups to ice skating? Calories were an easy first attempt, but involve a more complicated formula to determine progress.  After meeting with several health and medical experts through the university, we determined that taking the metabolic equivalent of each exercise (related to the expenditure of energy), and use time, and the perceived difficulty of the activity by the user to award points.  Since nearly every activity known to man has a measureable MET value, we were able to take the most recent and scientifically accurate values and put them in a database of exercises our users could choose from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;problem-solving&quot;&gt;Problem Solving:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal was to increase the userbase of Walk Georgia in order to benefit the overall health of the state.  It became very clear that creating a simple way to track fitness was a good start, but it would only target adults who were already interested in losing weight.  As we consulted with teachers, schools, and youth organizations, we heard time and time again that there was a need for a better tool to motivate students in physical education classes.  We decided to devote a large portion of our development timeline to add features specifically for schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/johnfrench.xyz/images/portfolio/walk-georgia/school-group.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;A picture of part of the Walk Georgia interface for school groups&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using our “Groups” functionality, or simply the ability for users to track their fitness progress together within our platform, we created special tools and measurement metrics for educational institutions.  Administrators could create groups for the whole school system, individual schools, or even individual classes.  What we saw was schools creating large groups and allowing the various P.E. classes to compete for prizes.  We added the ability for P.E. teachers to log activity for the entire class easily, and had special tracking reports they could generate to help keep track of progress.  If they wanted to add student activity individually, they could easily do that as well.  The adoption of Walk Georgia into physical education programs was a source of pride and accomplishment for our very small team - just to see our platform benefitting the lives of children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;resources&quot;&gt;Resources:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the work we did on fitness tracking systems and the social aspect of the platform, we wanted it to be an educational resource as well.  Our research indicated that many people in the state made dietary decisions based on very little accurate information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it was a goal of the platform to include healthy recipes and fitness tips alongside the fitness tracking platform.  Our main audience and user base was largely people who were resistant to exercise initially, so all of our resources attempted to start at the level of a beginner.  Many alternative fitness tracking systems see the physically active as their target audience.  While this makes sense from a marketing standpoint, it fails to truly benefit those who need it most, which was always the main thrust of Walk Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>UGA Extension Redesign</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/johnfrench.xyz/images/portfolio/extension/extension-portfolio.png&quot; alt=&quot;the extension logo above an image of cows&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;desctiption&quot;&gt;Desctiption:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UGA Extension is a branch of the University of Georgia that focuses primarily on community outreach and research.  With over a hundred different offices all over the state, Extension is a massive organization with a large online presence.  The needs of each office were sometimes vastly different, and my team and I had to develop a template and web platform that would work well for all users and all faculty and staff to increase overall productivity and help keep the budget stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a short study we conducted after the completion of redesign, we discovered that almost all offices saw an increase in community engagement through the website because of design decisions we made.  In particular, highlighting the office contact information and making it easier for users to get in touch with their office has led to an increase in services across Extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-challenges&quot;&gt;The Challenges:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Design a template within the parameters of the Extension style guidelines that would serve the diverse needs of each county office.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Develop centrally controlled “starter” content, in the event that a county office doesn’t have the content of their own, or the staff to be updating content frequently.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Design the CMS experience to be as user-friendly as possible, especially for people who have no web design or development experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/johnfrench.xyz/images/portfolio/extension/county-template.png&quot; alt=&quot;the UGA extension county template&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;flexible-templating&quot;&gt;Flexible Templating:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The size and scale of each Extension county office can be drastically different.  One county could have ten employees and have a massive outreach program, master gardening school, 4-H Youth programs, and more - while a different county office might be made up of only two people doing community outreach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the web presence of each of the county sites varied from five pages to five hundred pages.  Both needed to fit seamlessly into the same consistent template.  This presented a particular difficulty when it came to the navigational structure of our design.  We decided to go with a vertical side-navigation, because there was no way for us to determine the number of top-level pages the counties would need.  With a horizontal menu, you quickly run out of screen real-estate, but a vertical menu can continue indefinitely, and is easily supplemented by off-canvas mobile navigation, or something of the sort. The vertical navigation also allowed us to greatly increase the amount of sub-pages we could allow users to create.  With a horizontal navigation (especially using dropdowns), you can only show one or two child-level pages before it starts to create a very frustrating user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for our navigation design, we made clear and distinct parent and children levels to help users navigation and to help the content managers understand the structure of their content visually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/johnfrench.xyz/images/portfolio/extension/nav-progression.png&quot; alt=&quot;the progression of navigation items from parent to child pages&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dynamic-components&quot;&gt;Dynamic Components:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Extension redesign, one of the biggest problems we faced was the difficulty for our web managers to generate new content.  While some of the larger Extension offices had a dedicated web manager, most of the offices around the state don’t have the resources to hire a new employee.  The responsibility of maintaining the website would then fall to someone who had little or no experience doing so, which makes it hard to generate content, especially with all the other responsibilities each employee had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted to try and alleviate this stress from the offices with less resources, without limiting the functionality of the offices who had a dedicated web manager.  We accomplished this task through the use of dynamic components and some centrally managed content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a county created their new site for the first time, it was preloaded with relevant and helpful content we would pull from various University and Extension databases.  The content was deemed relevant and helpful by leadership from each department, and a county could have a fully functional site, with new and dynamic content coming in every day, without having to touch their site at all.  We could pull content from blogs, online Extension publications, new articles, events, and more.  Lastly, since a portion of this content was centrally maintained, any update or change would immediately get pushed to all sites that pulled the information, increasing the freshness and adoption of content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For offices who had their own content that they wanted to update regularly, it was as simple as dragging and dropping their own components in place of our pre-populated ones.  They still had access to all of the same features and tools, such as pulling from databases and blogs, but they are able to choose the source from which it came and have more control over the filtering options, etc.  Below is an example of how userss could simply drag and drop a “Personnel” component to have a list of their current staff load on whatever page their choose, without any coding or typing whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/johnfrench.xyz/images/portfolio/extension/component.png&quot; alt=&quot;a dynamic contact information component showing the employees of the office&quot; class=&quot;center-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if an employee’s position changes or they are transferred to a different office, as soon as their official status is changed in the central database, the update is immediately pushed to all sites and all pages with instances of that employee.  This is a tremendous time-saving managemnt tool.  Our web managers no longer have to worry about details like this and can focus on creating the content that is important to their user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;designing-for-cms&quot;&gt;Designing for CMS:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of simply designing and laying out all content in the traditional sense, we had to design modular components that would look good in any order, on any screen or column size, and with any content inside them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presents interesting challenges, like building containers that can handle images of any aspect ratio, without becoming to wide or tall, creating buttons or title bars that would work well if the title was one word or two sentences, and more.  We have used Adobe Experience Manager as our primary CSM.  While I would have advised going with an open source CMS, working with this Java-based platform definitely taught me a lot about what I like in a CMS and what drives me crazy.  But most importantly, I think it taught me that user experience design does not simply exist in the realm of the public facing features.  A lot of the work I did on this project was improving the tools and settings and control panels of various components to make them more intuitive for our web managers, which, in turn helped produce better content for the users themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: because of policies of the University of Georgia I am unable to directly share the GitHub repository, but the compiled mock ups can be viewed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
