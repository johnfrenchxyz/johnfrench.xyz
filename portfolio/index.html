                     As lead font-end developer for the University of Georgia College of Agricultural &amp; Environmental Sciences (which is a mouthfull), I was responsible for converting a mock up from a designer into a fully functional web template, and then subsequently assiting in the conversion of page elements into JSP templates for use in the Adobe Experience Manager CMS.  The rest of my time was spent designing and developing advanced components that would dynamically pull in news, events, images, and other forms of data to make the content manager's job as simple as possible.

                     In this case, I was responsible both for the initial UI design as well as the subsequent development of this template. The challanege was to build a template that could accomodate sites of all sizes, and with all manner of staff to maintain the design. What template and navigational structure could accomodate a site with four pages as well as a site with four hundred? A great deal of thought was put into the dynamic compoents that would comprise the content, as well as the template itself.

                     Beleive it or not, computers can help you exercise too! I was hired by the University of Georgia to do a complete design overhaul of the Walk Georgia program in partnership with the Coca-Cola Foundation. In addition to the design and development work, our team of two was responsible for a technical overhaul of the fitness tracking system. We developed a conversion formula that could accurately compare unrelated activities (yoga and swimming) and then award points to the user based on time, difficulty, etc. After being promoted, it was then my responsibility to assit in hiring another designer to maintain and continue the program.

                     This is a simple to-do list style application.  It was an exercise in vanilla JavaScript.  While jQuery has definite benefits, particularly cross-browser compatability, it is less effecient to use that vanilla JS.  This was one of the first web dev projects I did, that started my interest in single page JS apps.

Still trying to think of a catchy name for it, but right now it is function first!  Accessibility is one of my passions as a web designer/developer, so any way I can share that with others makes me happy!

He is a truly talented worker who hired me to help him construct his Squarespace site - and with this project, I got to play around with the source code, which made it infinitely more fun for me.
